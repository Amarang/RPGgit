4	fifthjoke	<i>Thank you for all your nice gifts. However, I couldn't use the car that<br> Michael gave me because I'm too old to go out anymore and the chauffeur is mean.<br> The new penthouse is nice, but it is too big for me to clean each day and I'm<br> only ever in the bedroom. But Lucas, you did a fine job in choosing a gift.<br> The chicken was delicious."</i>
